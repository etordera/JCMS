{"name":"JCMS","tagline":"Java Color Management System","body":"# Java Color Management System (JCMS)\r\nA Java library for easy management of ICC color transformations. It is basically a wrapper of [LittleCMS](http://www.littlecms.com) C library, with some helper classes.\r\n\r\n*by Enric Tordera (etordera at gmail dot com)*\r\n\r\n## Building JCMS\r\nJCMS uses [gradle](http://gradle.org) as a build system. You will also need:\r\n- Little CMS library (liblcms2-2)\r\n- GCC compiler for C++ (g++)\r\n- Java JDK\r\n\r\nOnce prerequisites are met, launch the build with:\r\n\r\n    gradle build\r\n    \r\nThis will generate the library as **JCMS.jar** inside *build/libs* directory.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nYou are free to use, modify and distribute this software as you please. If you feel JCMS is useful for you, giving me credit would be great, but is not mandatory.\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nThis software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty of any kind.
